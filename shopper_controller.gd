# TODO.hw - implement navigation pathing for shopper mobs
# will want a couple types: Grannies, Kiddos, Shelfstockers
# Grannies - meander to item spawn points, blocking the isle, stop and peruse items
# Shelfstockers - move at a moderate pace to item spawn points, takes direct paths, lingers to restock
# Kiddos - spawn of Satan, will run around with no concern for themselves or others

# TODO.hw - add a Manager control scheme that wanders the store and if seeing the player hunts
# them down to kick them out.


# TODO.hw - upon collision emit death
